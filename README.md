### About The Project
The app called "MovieFan" is an intuitive and user-friendly platform that helps users find and rate their favorite movies and series. The app offers many features that make it easy to find content and manage your personal lists.

**Main functions:**

- **Search and Browse:** The app allows users to easily search for movies and series by title. Search results contain detailed information including the title and year of publication.
  
- **Rating and Commenting:** Users can rate the content they watch.

- **Personal Lists:** Users can create their own lists, such as "Already Seen." The lists help you organize and keep track of the content you watch.

- **Average Rating:** The application automatically calculates the average rating of movies and series rated by the user. This makes it easy to determine how enjoyable the selected content is overall.

- **Summary in Lists:** The application displays the total number of minutes of movies and series in user-created lists. This allows users to plan and easily track how much time they spend on their favorite content.

The "MovieFan" application combines search, rating, and personal list management to provide users with a complete experience in the world of movies and series.

### Built With
- **React**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

### What I Learned
Developing "MovieFan" with React provided numerous valuable insights:

- **API Integration:** In the project, I used an API that provides detailed information about movies and series. Through this, I learned how to query, manage, and display data on the user interface.

- **State Management:** React's state management system offered the opportunity to transfer and update data between components. I used this functionality to track ratings, lists, and averages.

- **User Experience (UX):** During the project, I gained insights into designing intuitive user interfaces and applying UX principles, ensuring users can easily browse, rate, and track content within the app.

- **Project Structure and Modular Code:** During application development, I learned the importance of project structure and the modular design of components, which contributes to easier maintainability and scalability.

- **Testing and Debugging:** Throughout development, I experienced the importance of testing and debugging. I learned how to effectively test components and track and fix bugs.

All of these lessons have helped me to develop modern web applications more confidently and efficiently, and to better understand the use of React, Tailwind CSS, and the Vite framework in project development.
